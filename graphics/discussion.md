## Discussion

We have shown that it is possible to train a deep convolutional inverse graphics network with a fairly disentangled, interpretable graphics code layer representation from static images. By utilizing a deep convolution and de-convolution architecture within a variational autoencoder formulation, our model can be trained end-to-end using back-propagation on the stochastic variational objective function [@kingma2013auto]. We proposed a training procedure to force the network to learn disentangled and interpretable representations. Using 3D face and chair analysis as a working example, we have demonstrated the invariant and equivariant characteristics of the learned representations.
