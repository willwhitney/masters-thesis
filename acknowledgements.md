I would like to thank my girlfriend, Benjana, who is my joy. She lets me see my work through new eyes.


I thank Tejas Kulkarni for his mentorship and friendship. He has been my gateway into this world and a strong guiding influence, and I would not be here without him.


I thank Josh Tenenbaum for his guidance. He has pushed me to think about the most fundamental problems.


I thank my parents for their constant love and support. They made me this way, so please direct all complaints to them.


I thank Thomas Vetter for access to the Basel face model. I am grateful for support from the MIT Center for Brains, Minds, and Machines (CBMM).
